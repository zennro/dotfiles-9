;;; package --- My Emacs configuration

;;; Commentary:

;; My Emacs configuaration is stored in colbell.org and is
;; compiled into colbell.el via org-babel-load-file.

;;; Code:

;; I use keys that start with C-o for personal mappings.
(global-unset-key "\C-o")

;; Use org-babel-load-file to compile colbell.org into colbell.el and
;; then load colbell.el. Only do this if colbell.el doesn't exist or
;; if colbell.org is newer than colbell.el.
